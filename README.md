Interval Merge and Maximum XOR Subarray Coding Challenges

Problem 1: Interval Merge

Description
You are given an array (list) of interval pairs where each interval has a start and end timestamp. The input array is sorted by starting timestamps. Your task is to merge overlapping intervals and return the output array (list).

Input
An array of interval pairs sorted by starting timestamps.

Output
Merged array of intervals.


Problem 2: Maximum XOR Subarray
Description
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the subarray with the maximum XOR. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Input
An array arr[] of integers.
Output
Subarray with the maximum XOR.
